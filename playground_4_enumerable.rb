    # Are there any announcements written by a particular author?

    ### Sol 1
    result = false
    @announcements.each do |announcement|
      if announcement[:author] == "Arjun"
        result = true
      end
    end

    How many announcements were written by a particular author?

    ### Sol 1
    count = 0
    @announcements.each do |announcement|
      count +=  1 if announcement[:author].include? "Arvin"
    end
    puts count

    ### Sol 2

      announcements_array.count { |announcement| announcement[:author].include? author }
    end
    puts announcements_written_by('Arvin', @announcements)









    Find if two words are repeated anywhere, possible typos?

    ### Sol 1
    array_of_words = @announcements.first[:text].split

    repeat = false
    array_of_words.each_cons(2) do |two_words|
      repeat = true if two_words[0] == two_words[1]
    end
    puts repeat









    Pull out all of the posts that were written by a particular person

    ### Sol 1
    filtered_posts = []
    @announcements.each do |announcement|
      if announcement[:author].include? "Arvin"
        filtered_posts << announcement
      end
    end
    puts filtered_posts.count

    ### Sol 2
    name = "Arvin"
    filtered_posts = @announcements.find_all { |announcement| announcement[:author].include? name}
    puts filtered_posts







    Return the exact same array of hashes, with lowercase author names

    ### Sol 1
    filtered_posts = []
    @announcements.each do |announcement|
      announcement[:author] = announcement[:author].downcase
      filtered_posts << announcement
    end
    puts filtered_posts

    ### Sol 2
    filtered_posts = @announcements.map do |announcement|
      announcement[:author]
    end
    puts filtered_posts

















    ###### Extras


    Check if all of the announcements ae under a certain word length

    ### Sol 1
    result = @announcements.all? do |announcement|
      announcement[:text].split.count < 200
    end
    puts result
